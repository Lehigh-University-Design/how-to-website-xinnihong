<h3>1.Preheat the Oven:</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper to prevent sticking.
</p>
<h3>2.Cream the Butter and Sugars:</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened butter, granulated sugar, packed brown sugar, and vanilla extract together until the mixture is creamy and smooth.</p>
<h3>3.Add Eggs:</h3>
    <p>Beat in the eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition until the batter is well combined.
</p>
   <h3> Combine Dry Ingredients:</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add this dry mixture to the wet mixture, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.
</p>
    <h3>5.Add Chocolate Chips:</h3>
      <p>Gently fold in the chocolate chips using a spatula or wooden spoon. Make sure the chocolate chips are evenly distributed throughout the dough.
</p>
    <h3>6.Scoop the Dough:</h3>
    <p>Use a cookie scoop or a spoon to drop rounded tablespoons of cookie dough onto the prepared baking sheets. Leave some space between the cookies to allow for spreading.
</p>
    <h3>7.Bake the Cookies:</h3>
    <p>Place the baking sheets in the preheated oven and bake for about 9 to 11 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown but the centers still look slightly soft. Remember that cookies will continue to bake a little after you take them out of the oven due to residual heat.
</p>
    <h3>8.Cool and Enjoy:</h3>
    <p>Remove the baking sheets from the oven and let the cookies cool on the sheets for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.
</p>
    <h3>3.Serve:</h3>
    <P>Once the cookies are completely cool, they are ready to be enjoyed! Serve with a glass of milk or your favorite beverage.
</P>
    
<h2>Tips:</h2>
    
    <p>
      <ol>
      <li>For extra flavor, consider adding chopped nuts like walnuts or pecans to the dough.
</li>
      <li>You can use different types of chocolate chips or chunks, such as milk chocolate, dark chocolate, or white chocolate.
</li>
      <li>If you prefer softer cookies, slightly underbake them by reducing the baking time.
</li>
      <li>Store any leftover cookies in an airtight container to maintain their freshness.
</li>
      <li>Now you're all set to bake a batch of delicious chocolate chip cookies!
